# **Liiga game goals**

## Usage

``` r
liiga_game_goals(season, game_id)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). Game ids repeat across seasons, so a
  game is (season, game_id).

- game_id:

  Game id (game_id in liiga_schedule or liiga_games), e.g. 1; unique
  only within a season.

## Value

A `fastRhockey_data` tibble (30 columns; zero rows when a valid payload
has none).

## Details

Endpoint: `GET https://liiga.fi/api/v2/games/{season}/{game_id}`

Seasons are END years (2026 = 2025-26), the same key as sdv-py. Requests
to liiga.fi are spaced at least one second apart. A request Liiga
answers with nothing (an unknown game, a tournament not played that
season, a shot map before 2016) raises `fastRhockey_no_data`; a failed
fetch or an error-shaped answer raises `fastRhockey_asset_fetch`; a bad
argument raises `fastRhockey_bad_request`.
